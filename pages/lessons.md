I teach piano and guitar to both adults and children. My specialties are jazz, music theory, song writing and improvisation. 

Lessons are generally given from my home in Den Haag (Mariahoeve), but I may be able to travel to you. Rates start at â‚¬25/hr. For further details, [contact me](https://carmelfreeman.com/pages/contact.html).
